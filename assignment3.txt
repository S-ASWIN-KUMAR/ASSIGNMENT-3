Element: Elements define the structure and content of a web page. 
Examples include:<div> for divisions
<p> for paragraphs
<a> for hyperlinks
Attribute: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. 
Examples include:
src for specifying the source of an image
height and width for specifying dimensions
href for specifying the URL of a link

displayed correctly on web pages.

&reg; or &#174; for the registered trademark symbol (®)

keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
